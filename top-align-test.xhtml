The main issue is people treating rules / laws / "orders from above" / what other people think / social norms / <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/comments/364868137">
scientific 'facts'</a>
 - even religious decrees or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States">

<p>
I
 met open-minded, enlightened, even self-critical, observant Jews,
Christians, or Muslims (and a Sri-Lankan woman, who took care of my
grandmother during her later years, identifies as <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/thought_you_were_a_Perl_guy.xhtml">
both a Christian and a Buddhist</a>
). I also met close-minded and "professionally fanatic" <a href="https://xkcd.com/">

), and professional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/2d9fo7/postrelease_movie_discussion_thread_2/">

 fans</a>
. And this is to say nothing of fanatical fans or fanatical foes of Apple Corp, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">

, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">
BSD family of operating systems</a>
 - all of which have or had notoriously ardent zealots.</p>
<p>
I decided to try and (at least passively) incorporate memes from other idea-systems or franchises <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/atheism_can_be_a_religion.xhtml">
even if they have some fanatical zealots</a>
.</p>
<p>
And
 naturally, the harm done by overzealous xkcd fans (who usually at most
can ban one from an Internet subforum) is small compared to the
destructiveness of the Nazis, or early communists to say nothing of
Genghis Khan's army. Note however that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">
later communists were reformed</a>
 and that most of the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">
"alt-right"</a>

the Colbert Report</a>

<p>
Similarly, I suspect <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16099">
Ezekiel I</a>
 was originally intended as an exaggerated parody of Polytheistic visions of revelation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezekiel">
Ezekiel</a>
 who was <a href="#craziness_and_nevua">
a standup philosopher/comedian</a>
. Generations of scholars who considered it holy have tried to divine meaning from it, but it is pointless: Ezekiel was just <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=mjd-how-to-ask-a-good-question-1">
making shit up</a>
.</p>
<p>
I also suspect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)">
Plato’s "Republic"</a>
 was similarly half tongue-in-cheek by Plato who described how he thought a country really <b>
should not</b>

 be run. That was for the entertainment and education of the Greeks, who
 may have heard or uttered similar sentiments, and found them ridiculous
 when lumped together.</p>

<p>
Anyway, as humans we are capable of challenging certain dogmata or taboos in certain cases. This includes: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Acme::NewMath">
Peano's axioms of arithmetics</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For
 thousands of years, we have been plagued by mathematicians insisting
that two plus two equals four. Who elected them? I, Stevie-O, am
promoting an entirely new system, where two plus two equals FIVE ["2 + 2
 = 5"]. Eventually, it will be extended to provide other stuff these
power-hungry madmen kept hidden away for themselves, such as division by
 zero, cold fusion, the ability to solve the halting problem, and the
secret to attracting hot chicks.</p>

<p>
or Aristotlian Logic:</p>

 open source? Yes, and no.";</q>
</p>
<p>
(That was written before qmail's change of licensing.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<q>
I believe in God, and I don't believe in God.</q>
</p>
<p>
(As I overheard one young local school girl say to her friend a few weeks ago.)</p>

<p>
And we can certainly challenge:</p>

If
 you’ve ever visited the ultra-orthodox Jewish communities of Jerusalem,
 all of whom agree in complete and utter adherence to every iota of
Jewish law, you will discover that despite general agreement on what
constitutes kosher food, that you will not find a rabbi from one
ultra-orthodox community who is willing to eat at the home of a rabbi
from a different ultra-orthodox community. And the web designers are
discovering what the Jews of Mea Shearim have known for decades: just
because you all agree to follow one book doesn’t ensure compatibility,
because the laws are so complex and complicated and convoluted that it’s
 almost impossible to understand them all well enough to avoid traps and
 landmines, and you’re safer just asking for the fruit plate.</p>

,
 at the time (despite its vulgarity). It demonstrated that most judges
(or juries for that matter) followed reason, gut feeling, prejudice,
etc. rather than the letter of the bylaws, legal code, regulations, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent">
legal precedents</a>
 when formulating their judgements. This is given the complexity, volume, and the contradictory nature of the latter.</p>
<p>
As <a href="#what_is_hacking">
hacker monarchs and action heroes</a>
,
 we should constantly challenge the 'rules' / 'laws' that we abide by to
 defy our fate. I do not encourage people to murder people, vandalise
property, rape, or steal for vanity (rather than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VdZewCFyfg">
for self-support like Disney's Alladdin</a>
) and you <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#benevolent-psychological-warfare">
should try to "be excellent to each other"</a>
, but there are many guidelines that were or seemed beneficial at the time that no longer are.</p>
<p>
Guidelines <b>
are</b>
 important for the philosophical processes of thought and communication. But they should not be taken as gospel or dogma.</p>
